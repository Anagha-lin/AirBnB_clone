# Airbnb Clone Project

This project aims to create an Airbnb clone, complete with a command-line interface (CLI) for managing Airbnb objects. The CLI allows users to interact with the system, create objects, retrieve information, and perform various operations.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter provides an interactive and non-interactive mode for managing Airbnb objects. It supports a set of commands to perform actions such as creating users, listing properties, and more.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script.

```bash
$ ./console.py
